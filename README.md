===================

Team Mysterious Box (2nd place in McGill CodeJam 2013)

For the competitions, we have to create a web app can accurately predict future energy use by the McGill community. Our web app must be able to take data input via command line and generate output base on selected input. Furthermore, our website should be able to show future energy use via diagram.

We place our final product on OpenShift.

Here is the site: http://zend-mysteriousbox.rhcloud.com/
